# Capstone readme
[The API used](https://openweathermap.org/)

This app is built with Python/Flask and uses the jinja2 templating engine to display weather information dynamically on each page. This was one of my capstone projects through Springboard and uses a Postgres database to store the information from the API to prevent multiple requests which would hinder performance and scalability. It also keeps track for each location in the database how many times that location has been searched and displays the most popularly searched places on the front page.
